The main idea behind this project was the idea of having “information” that depending on its sensitivity would be locked behind a certain level of security. This concept was then later adapted in the following manner where security access was locked behind the unlocking method depending on how hard it would be for a bad actor to obtain it. So, then the hierarchy was made where RFID tags were attributed the lowest level of access, the keypad was attributed the second level access, and finally the frequency tone detector was given the highest level of access. Based on the access level, users could unlock one or more solenoids.
